But because setURLStreamHandlerFactor was used there haven been problems with two such file system. the method is allowed ot be called only once per VM. Thus the tests have been merged. GSE was not picking up precompiled dependencies correctly, thus additional information had to be kept (GSE#precompiledEntries) during the compilation to later on add those to the dependency as if they were compiled normally.\n",

The bootstraping method has been unified for all types of calls, so that constructor invocations as well as normal method calls can go through the same bootstrapper. In InvokeDynamicWriter a null adapter was used to show an constrcutor path to be easily be able to reuse the InvocationWriter infrastructor. Also a \"callsite name\" was introduced, since the verifier does not allow <init> method names in invokedynamic based invocations. CachedConstructor got an getCachedClass to be able to get to the direct call information to enable indy to unreflect. To support the bean constructor with properties a method setBeanProperties has been added to IndyInterface as a handle callback.\n",

Now it is possible to have parts in the command expression that do realize a method call without needing the next element as argument (a b c() d e == a(b).c().d(e)). Also this allows trailing elements as properties (a b c == a(b).c). Also allowed is to have things like (a b c[1](){} d e) which allows the direct attachment of closures as according to the proposal as well as various ways to reaplce methods with expressions. NOTE: this breaks compatibility a little since a{}b{} will no longer be (a{}).call(b{b}), but a({}).b({}). This way one of Groovy's easter eggs will be not available anymore\n",

      "aa3d4f34e2 This commit adds back the catching and unwrapping of GroovyRuntimeException to several places. Many files have been changed only to add 'throws Throwable' to the method header. The callsite generator will now add a try catch block with unwrapping for compiled methods. ACG will no longer add the additional catch block for GroovyRuntimeException. ScriptBytecodeAdapater is hardly used in 1.6 but sometimes it still is, so the exception unwrapping logic has moved in there again. In general the unwrapping is needed for 2 cases. We have stackless exceptions, that do need a stack. It is not enough for them to catch these exceptions in a general try-catch block in the generated method, because then the line number information would not match. Also we have InvokerInvocationExceptions, that carry the real exception that happened during a method call done by the meta class. for normal try-catch blocks written in groovy these exceptioons have to be unwrapped. With the missing unwrapping in ScriptBytecodeAdapter we needed to add an additional try-catch to any user defined try-catch. This is no longer needed and removed from ACG. AFAIK the performance is not influenced by this commit.\n",

Tomcat for example uses it's own implementaion of the Servlet API, but in newer versions these classes are hidden. Normally this is no problem in Java as we can uses these hidden classes through interfaces or objects, that are visible. But the Reflector used always the object name, so this resulted in a strange ClassNotFoundException. The class couldn't be found because the Reflector is part of another class laoder and can't be part of the same ClassLoader as the orignal class in all cases (for exmaple if the groovy classes are not visible).\n",

Builders didn't support having attributes and content on a node, so that was added.  Instead of adding the DOM methods DefaultGroovyMethods, I introduced a dynamic way to do this using a global \"use\" method.  Simply call this method with a class similar in format to DefaultGroovyMethods to add new methods only for the current thread.  It might be interesting to change the scope at a later date, but that is what it is now.  I refer to these in the code as Categories, like obj-c and smalltalk do.  You can see in DOMTest.groovy how they are used.  I am disatisfied with the way toString(Object) and asIterator() work right now.  I would like those to be broken out, instead of being a giant method.  I think that some sort of conversion pipeline might be the way to do that.  The changes to support Categories was limited to the Invoker and an addition global method.\n",
